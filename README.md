# Coin View App

A great start point to introduce VIPER architecture, native animations and some nice frameworks integration.

### Basic steps:

1 - Create an account in Firebase

2 - Add your own google services file to the project

3 - Run `pod install` on the project folder to download all dependencies with Cocoapods

4 - Open `${Project_Name}.xcworkspace`

5 - Analyse the project structure and take it to another level!

### Design pattern

This boilerplate has the basic structure for coding with VIPER design pattern (read about it [here](https://www.ckl.io/blog/ios-project-architecture-using-viper/)).
